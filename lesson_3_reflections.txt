When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with a team.
    When using more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Work may not be ready to be shared.  

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   Forks are a copy of a github repository on your own repository. Clones are a a copy of a github repository on your computer. Branches are different evolutions of code within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  Something to do with fast-forward merge may be? Not sure. I need to understand fetch and pull better.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

   Without Git or GitHub we could collaborate by sending a file back and forth, and comparing using something like diff. I can see that there would be unforeseen situations where things would go wrong or where it would be ackward to collaborate. I have not thought enough about Git to see if it really has figured out what it takes to collaborate. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
